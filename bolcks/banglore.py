# TREE #
In our, around many trees are there and different variety.
I Love the rose flower in red colour and hibiscus also like.
in life, the tree is very important. because they are giving oxygen, fruits, wood and many things.then water is raining because of the tree. 
many school and colleges are growing a tree. this is a good thing
everyone known tress is very important for our health also .but many people cut the tree.
but why they cut the tree they known rainy is coming because of tree
In Bangalore city, many coconut tree and many trees are here. that why here the weather is cool. and suddenly any season rainy came.
if you are cut the tree so water can't come and most of the people frustrated with water.
so save the water don't waste water and don't cut the tree.
Our government decided on many new ideas.
